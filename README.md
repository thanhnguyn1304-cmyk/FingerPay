# FingerPay 👆💸

**Finnovative Hackathon 2025 MVP**

> **Pay with a touch.** Assign different wallets to different fingers for seamless payments.

## 💡 The Concept

FingerPay revolutionizes biometrics by mapping specific fingerprints to distinct payment sources. No more fumbling for cards or switching apps—just use the right finger.

*   **👇 Personal Wallet** (e.g., Index Finger) -> Daily expenses, coffee, groceries.
*   **💍 Family Wallet** (e.g., Ring Finger) -> Shared household costs, utilities.
*   **💼 Business Wallet** (e.g., Middle Finger) -> Work expenses, travel, client meals.
